                <p>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different
                    concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors,
                    and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and
                    applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.</p>
                <p>Designed to be usable by all Open Web developers, this reference page links to numerous resources
                    about HTML5 technologies, classified into several groups based on their function.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Semantics: allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.</li>
                    <li>Connectivity: allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.</li>
                    <li>Offline and storage: allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate
                        offline more efficiently.</li>
                    <li>Multimedia: making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.</li>
                    <li>2D/3D graphics and effects: allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.</li>
                    <li>Performance and integration: providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer
                        hardware.</li>
                    <li>Device access: allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.</li>
                    <li>Styling: letting authors write more sophisticated themes.</li>

                        CSS has been extended to be able to style elements in a much
                        more complex way. This is often referred as CSS3, though CSS is not a monolithic specification
                        any more and the different modules are not all at level 3: some are at level 1 and others at
                        level 4, with all the intermediate levels covered.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>New background styling features</dt>
                        <dd>It is now possible to put shadows on elements using <code>box-shadow</code>, multiple
                            backgrounds, and CSS <code>filter</code>s.
                            You can learn more about these by reading Advanced box
                            effects.</dd>
                        <dt>More fancy borders</dt>
                        <dd>Not only it is now possible to use images to style borders, using <code>border-image</code>
                            and its associated
                            longhand properties, but rounded borders are supported via the <code>border-radius</code>
                            property.</dd>

                            animate parts of the page without a triggering event, you can now control mobile elements on
                            your page.</dd>

                        <dd>Authors have better control to reach better typography. They can control
                            <code>text-overflow</code> and hyphenation, but also can add a
                            shadow to it or control more precisely its decorations. Custom typefaces can be
                            downloaded and applied thanks to the new <code>@font-face</code> at-rule.</dd>
                        <dt>New presentational layouts</dt>
                        <dd>In order to improve the flexibility of designs, two new layouts have been added: the CSS

                            layouts and CSS
